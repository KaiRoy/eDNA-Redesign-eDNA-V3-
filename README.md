## Description

I have worked on the eDNA project at the OPEnS Lab for the past two years and during that time I noticed a couple of things that I wanted to change about the electronics board (Dubbed eDNA Electronics V2). I never had the time to make those changes so I decided to make a Project course out of it to ensure that I would. This meant I had to limit the number of changes that I wanted to make for time purposes. Here were the goals for the project/redesign:
- Allowing for 5V sensor support (mainly I2C sensors)
- 

## Design



## Current State of the Project



## What would I do differently? What changes would I make?



## Installation

What EDA libraries and files are needed for this project?
- eDNA Library
- Various Component Libraries
<!-- Make a singular Library for all of the components Symbols and footprints -->
<!-- Insert a link to a library guide or make my own -->

<!-- Add a link to the firmware installation guide -->
<!-- Note which code version to use -->

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits
